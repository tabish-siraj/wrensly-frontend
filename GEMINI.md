### Wrensly is currently not an open-source social media app, this will work same as Twitter ### but better, more secure, and no censorship at all, will later be open-sourced when Web3 ### is introduced.

### Right now, working on MVP, where Posts and Notifications will be working smoothly.

### Thanks for the attention to this matter.
